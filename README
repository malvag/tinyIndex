# tinyIndex library

### At the time of turnin:

Not implemented/completed (due to limited time):
    - multi-threaded driver
    - not succesfull run of YCSB, but the YCSB-driver was partially implemented
    - a small bug in the recovery, where i allocate more blobs for the index, the data and the index though are intact 

You can compile the library with my test using:
```bash
make

mkdir <data_directory>

# The default test will
#   - create 1000 kv pairs
#   - read 1000 of them
#   - and iterate with scan 1000 of them
./test <data_directory>


# for cleanup
make clean

```
