# tinyblob library

### At the time of turnin:

Not implemented (due to limited time):
    - mutex
    - threaded driver, that does sync and async IOs
    - recovery for blob_metadata in the block version of the library after shutdown
    - aio support


You can compile the library with my test using:
```bash
#for the tinyblob with file support
make file_test

#for the tinyblob with block support
make block_test

mkdir <data_directory>

./test <data_directory>



# for cleanup
make clean

```
