# tinyLog library

### At the time of turnin:

Fixed every bug from previous submissions

You can compile the library with my test using:
```bash
make

mkdir <data_directory>

# The default test will
#   - create 10000 kv pairs
#   - read 10000 of them
#   - and iterate with scan all of them
./test <data_directory>


# for cleanup
make clean

```
